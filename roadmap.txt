Planned features:
- UI element in TaskModal that allows you to just select a date from the TaskModal and the task moves to that day.
- Streamlined login screen with no white background that does not require email verification
- Fix the month picker so that the arrow keys when navigating between months don't bounce around all crazy
- Ability for subtasks to exist on a different day from their parent task
